## User story

_User story is an informal, general explanation of the software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. We will use it to prioritized tasks that sould be accomplished._

To do that, we are giving description of tasks and we address to each a mark of priority :
* Priority 1 : A first level feature 🚩🚩🚩🚩
* Priority 2 : A fundamental feature 🚩🚩🚩
* Priority 3 : An important feature  🚩🚩
* Priority 4 : An optional feature   🚩

| User type     | Action description   | Priority |
| ------------- |:---------------------| :-------:|
| Professor 👨‍🏫    | Login (email + pswd) |   🚩    |
